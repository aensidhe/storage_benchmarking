### Servers launch

- mysql.server start (/etc/my.cnf)
- redis-server redis.conf
- tarantool box.lua

### Assumptions

Redis will run without background saves, it listens to `localhost:6379`.
MySql has enough memory and database `hs_test`. There should be table `table_test(int not null auto_increment primary key, str nvarchar(1024))`.

It has installed handlersocket plugin, which listens to `localhost:9998`.

Anonymous access should be enabled.

### How to run

1. First you should populate data:
	
	1. `node ./data/redis.js`
	2. `node ./data/mysql.js`
	3. `node ./data/tarantool.js`
	
2. Then you just run the test and watch.

### Problems

1. node eats a lot CPU by itself. We are not pushing storages to its limits.

### Tests

- redis - `node-redis` library with hiredis
- ioredis - `ioredis` library with hiredis
- node-handlersocket - `node-handlersocket` library
- manual-hs - fast and dirty implementation of handlersocket protocol
- tarantool - `tarantool-driver` library

### Results

As we can see from results, not surprisingly, async model is much preferrable for node.js application. Also we see that recommended client for handler-socket can't hold pressure of 500K simultaneous requests and quickly degrade.

In general handlersocket is 4 times slower than redis.
